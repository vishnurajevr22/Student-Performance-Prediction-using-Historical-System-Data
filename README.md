# Student-Performance-Prediction-using-Historical-System-Data
Student Performance Prediction using ML, 1200 students dataset (fail and pass rate) ,Predicts A/B/C/Fail grades from 4 features 
# Problem Statement 
     The primary objective of this project is to develop a machine learning-based predictive system that accurately forecasts student academic performance based on historical behavioral and academic data. The system analyzes multiple factors including attendance, study hours, quiz scores, and practice test performance to predict null grades.
# Abstract 
Educational institutions face challenges in:
•	Identifying at-risk students early
•	Predicting student performance accurately
•	Optimizing academic interventions
•	Allocating resources efficiently
This project addresses these challenges through data-driven predictive analytics.
Project Scope:
•	Dataset: 1,200 student records with realistic features
•	Features: Study hours, practice tests, quiz average, attendance percentage
•	Output: Predictive grades (A/B/C/Fail)
Technology: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Google Colab Pass Rate: 60% (realistic distribution)
# THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF MY PROJECT 

"Use Machine Learning to predict student grades from their study habits and attendance."


This project takes 4 simple inputs:

•	How many hours they study

•	How many practice tests they take

•	Their quiz scores

•	Their attendance percentage

And predicts their final grade: A, B, C, or Fail.

# Result
**PASS/FAIL CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY: 93%**
✅ From your RMSE 6.5 model
✅ Trainer's 60% minimum → I GOT 93%
